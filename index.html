        <p>My name is Brittany Boughter and I am new to the tech world but love the challenge.
          For the last ten years, I was working as a police dispatcher.
          Coding has reminded me of my childhood and watching my mom as a dispatcher.
          Using command lines are an intregal part of dispatching even today and it's exciting to learn how the gibberish gets translated by the computer.
          So far I have taken a prepatory class with LearningFuze and hope to continue my education with the full-time program.
          I have a passion for sports and am seeking a career that is tech and sports related.</p>
        <p>My inspiration to switch careers comes from my want to spend more family time with my husband and kids.
          Even though I know that I need to work hard to get myself established, this career still provides me more flexibilty.
          I was raised on the idea of needing to put your career first to provide for your family but I have learned
          recently that life is to short and there needs to be a healthy balance.</p>
